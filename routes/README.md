# Install Dependencies
  - Make sure NPM is installed
  - package.json contains all the dependencies 
  - After cloning the repository just do `npm install` in the terminal or cmd in the project directory. This should install all the dependencies for this project. 
  - You will also need Nodemon, which allows you to run and test your application. 
    - Use this command to install Nodemon: `npm install -g nodemon`

# Run the server
  - To run the website, do `nodemon app.js` in the terminal. Express will serve `App.js` on localhost. 
  - Go to URL `localhost:5000` on your browser. 5000 is the default port to run the website locally.
  
  - You should see 'Hello World!' this means your project is set up!
